The file F2_CEN_fitness_pheno_data_for_aster.csv contains phenotypic and fitness data of the F2 crosses collected over a period of three years in our high and low elevation transplant sites. The F2 crosses are derived from two F1 families that were produced by controlled crosses between one low and one high elevation plant. To generate the F2s, 15-28 F1 individuals were placed in cages in a greenhouse facility and supplemented with butterflies (Pieris brassicae) to act as pollinators. This approach produced three types of recombinant groups: offspring of each of the two F1 families, and hybrids between these. The F2 seeds were sown in a greenhouse and the resulting seedlings were transplanted to one high and one low elevation transplant site following a randomized block design. The plants in the field sites were monitored for the flowering seasons 2019-2021 and fitness, rosette size and flowering time data were continuously collected. The dataset contains time point specific survival, flowering incidence, fecundity, rosette size and flowering time. ## Description of the data and file structure*Variable name - Description* barcode Ð unique identifier for each individual plantsite - transplant sitecluster Ð recombinant groupCEN Ð genotype at the DsCEN/2 locussurv_start19 - survival at the start of the growing season 2019surv_start20 - survival at the start of the growing season 2020surv_start21 - survival at the start of the growing season 2021start19_size Ð rosette size (cm) at the start of the 2019 growing season start20_size Ð rosette size (cm) at the start of the 2020 growing seasonstart21_size Ð rosette size (cm) at the start of the 2021 growing seasonflowered19 Ð flowering incidence during the 2019 growing seasonflowered20 Ð flowering incidence during the 2020 growing seasonflowered21 Ð flowering incidence during the 2021 growing seasonday19 Ð flowering time (start of flowering day) during the 2019 growing seasonday20 Ð flowering time (start of flowering day) during the 2020 growing seasonday21 Ð flowering time (start of flowering day) during the 2021 growing seasonseed_count19 Ð number of seeds produced during the 2019 growing season seed_count20 Ð number of seeds produced during the 2020 growing seasonseed_count21 Ð number of seeds produced during the 2021 growing season
