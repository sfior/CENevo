Description of phenotypic traits measured from the experimental populations growing in a common garden at the ETH greenhouse facility (Zurich, Switzerland). Floral traits are measured on the first dehiscent flower of each plant and its bearing stalk. In D. carthusianorum, these refer to single flowers of the inflorescence.  


Flowering date: Days at anthesis of the first flower as scaled to the first flowering plant within the experimental population of each species. 
Rosette diameter (mm): Mean of two orthogonal measurements of the basal rosette (1)
N leaves stalk: Number of opposite cauline leaves
Stalk height (mm): Length of stalk from the basal rosette to the receptacle (1)
Stalk width (mm): Width of the stalk as measured at its base (1)
Calyx length (mm): Length of calyx from the receptacle to the apex of one fused sepal (2)
Calyx width (mm): Width of calyx at its largest point (1)
Flower length (mm): Mean length of three petal claws (2)
Petal area (mm2): Mean area of three petal blades (2)
Petal length (mm): Mean length of three petal blades (2)
Petal width (mm): Mean width of three petal blades (2)
Bract length (mm): Mean length of two bracts (2)
Bract width (mm): Mean width of two bracts (2)
Ovary length (mm): Length of ovary (2) 
Ovary width (mm): Width of ovary at its largest point (2)
