//	Define estimation method
//	Recall that when setting independentReplicates, the obs file should contain multiple entries (one per line), where each entry is the sumstats calculated from one (neutral) region. The algorithm then consider each region as an independent replicate, on which it subsequently calculates the posteriors.

//	Calculates the tukey depth P-value. This calculates the Tukey depth (the minimum number of sample points on one side of a hyperplane through the point, i.e. a measure of how centered a point is in an overall cloud of points) of the observed data and contrasts it with the Tukey depth of the distribution of all retained simulation points (hence argument should be equal or less than numRetained), to produce a p-value. If the observed point is close to the center of the retained simulations, we expect that most

//	Calculates the marginal density P-value. Similar in approach to the above, this tag calculates the P-value for the marginal density of the observed datapoint by doing so for the observed datapoint and the retained simulations (distribution)

//	If the parameter writeRetained is defined and set to 1, ABCestimator writes two files: one containing the parameter and statistics of the retained simulations and one with the smoothed parameter distribution of the retained simula- tions (see

//	Posterior estimation settings
//	Since ABCestimator standardizes the parameters internally to the range [0, 1] diracPeakWidth, the same diracPeakWidth value is used for all parameters. Too small values of diracPeakWidth will result in wiggly posterior curves, too large values might unduly smear out the curves. The best advice is to run the calculations with several choices for diracPeakWidth. The choice of diracPeakWidth depends on the number of retained simulations: the larger the number of retained parameter values, the sharper the smaller diracPeakWidth can be cho- sen in order to still get a rather smooth result. If the parameter diracPeakWidth is not defined, ABCestimator uses as value of 0.001, unless the parameter numRetained is defined. In this case ABCestimator sets Ïƒk = 1/N, where N is the number of simulations to retain, as proposed by Leuenberger and Wegmann (2009).
//diracPeakWidth 0.02

//	ABCestimator calculates the density of the marginal posteriors on a number of equally spaced points along the range of every parameter. The number of such points is specified with the parameter posteriorDensityPoints with default value 100.
