Scripts and datasets associated with the manuscript "Ancient alleles drive contemporary climate adaptation in an alpine plant"

**Population genomics**


**Phylogeny**

ABBA_BABA_data_and_scripts

- testing introgression across the Dianthus radiation by computation of ABBA-BABA (D-statistics) against the Dianthus phylogeny species tree




**Ecology**

01 Phenotypic divergence measured in common garden

02 Flowering time measurements for GWAS


**Demography**

ABC_coalmod_speciation_Ds_data_and_scripts

- Appoximate Bayesian Computation with coalescent simulations, model choice and parameter inference under the best model, with the aim to estimate the speciation time for Ds (Dianthus slyvestris) from its sister lineage 
- simulations under the best-fitting model to estimate the time to coalescence at the DsCEN locus from a geeographically widespread sample of haplotypes

- PROBLEM: I can not upload one of the data files:
	Demography/ABC_coalmod_speciation_Ds_data_and_scripts/parameter_estimation_simulations/ABCstat.ddRAD_Dianthus.SI.exponential_growth.txt.gz is 202.47 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB
	
	should I just split this up into chunks, or should it be uploaded somewhere else?
