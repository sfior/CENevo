Scripts and datasets associated with the manuscript "Ancient alleles drive contemporary climate adaptation in an alpine plant"

**Population genomics**


**Phylogeny**

ABBA_BABA_data_and_scripts

- testing introgression across the Dianthus radiation by computation of ABBA-BABA (D-statistics) against the Dianthus phylogeny species tree



**Haplotype data**
Sequences and scripts for the CEN and TCF1 loci


**Ecology**

01 Phenotypic divergence measured in common garden

02 Flowering time measurements for GWAS


**Demography**

ABC_coalmod_speciation_Ds_data_and_scripts

- Appoximate Bayesian Computation with coalescent simulations, model choice and parameter inference under the best model, with the aim to estimate the speciation time for Ds (Dianthus slyvestris) from its sister lineage 
- simulations under the best-fitting model to estimate the time to coalescence at the DsCEN locus from a geeographically widespread sample of haplotypes
